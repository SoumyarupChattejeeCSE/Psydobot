# Psydobot
A front-end user interactive website integrated with Psychological Doctor Bot (chat-bot), along with questionnaire for predicting mental disorders, analyzing stress and providing solutions. We also have used the Google Map API to help the people find hospitals near them which will help them save their time and can direct report to the hospitals if they are suffering from any mental disorders.

This project comprises of three main modules:
1. A chatbot to predict the mental disorders which the user might be suffering from.
2. A location- indicator module which uses Google Map Development API, to inform the user regarding the nearby doctors, and their respective clinics, hospitals, specializing in the treatment of the mental disorder, 
   the user might be suffering from.
3. A questionnaire to help the user find out their stress levels and depending on the stress levcels, provide solutions like exercises, yogas, ASMR videos, etc.
